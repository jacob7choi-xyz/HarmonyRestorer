o resolve the PyTorch and CUDA library issues in the Replit environment by ensuring that you are using the CPU-only version of PyTorch, you'll want to take the following steps:

1. Install the CPU-only Version of PyTorch
PyTorch provides specific packages for CPU-only installations to avoid any conflicts with CUDA. You can install PyTorch without CUDA by modifying the requirements.txt file in your Replit environment.

Update your requirements.txt with the following line to install the CPU-only version of PyTorch:

plaintext
Copy code
torch==2.0.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
This ensures that you are installing the CPU-only version of PyTorch, and the link points to the appropriate repository where these binaries are hosted.

If you also need torchaudio, include the CPU version of torchaudio as well:

plaintext
Copy code
torchaudio==2.0.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
2. Check the Current PyTorch Installation
Ensure that any previous versions of PyTorch with CUDA are removed before reinstalling the CPU-only version. You can do this by running the following in the Replit shell:

bash
Copy code
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
This will remove any existing installations that might include CUDA.

3. Install the CPU-only Version
Once you’ve updated the requirements.txt file, run the following command to install the CPU-only versions of PyTorch and torchaudio (if needed):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Verify Installation
After the installation, you can verify that the CPU-only version of PyTorch is installed by running the following script in your Replit environment:

python
Copy code
import torch

print(torch.__version__)  # Should print the installed version of PyTorch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should return False, indicating no CUDA support
This will confirm that the installed PyTorch version is CPU-only and that CUDA is not available in your current environment.

5. Additional Troubleshooting
Clear Caches: Sometimes, clearing the pip cache and forcing a fresh installation of PyTorch can resolve issues. You can do this by running:

bash
Copy code
pip cache purge
pip install -r requirements.txt
Replit-specific limitations: Replit’s environment may not fully support libraries that rely heavily on GPU-based computations, such as CUDA-enabled versions of PyTorch, which is why switching to a CPU-only version is important.

Once these steps are completed, your environment should be configured to use PyTorch without CUDA, and you should no longer encounter CUDA-related issues.

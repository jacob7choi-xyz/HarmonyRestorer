The error you’re encountering is related to incompatible versions of numpy and possibly other packages like librosa or scipy. This can happen when a library is compiled with a specific version of numpy that doesn’t match the version currently installed in your environment.

Here’s how to resolve the issue step-by-step:

1. Update numpy and Dependencies
The first step is to ensure that numpy and all related dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with each other. Use the following commands to update numpy:

bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade numpy
Additionally, you should also update scipy and librosa to make sure everything is compatible:

bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade scipy librosa
2. Check the Installed Versions
After updating, check the installed versions to verify they are compatible. You can check the versions of numpy, scipy, and librosa using:

bash
Copy code
pip show numpy scipy librosa
Make sure all of these libraries are the latest stable versions.

3. Clear Python Caches
Sometimes Python can have issues with outdated caches or files from previous versions. You can clear them by running:

bash
Copy code
pip cache purge
Then reinstall the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy scipy librosa
4. Force Reinstallation
If updating doesn’t resolve the issue, you can try forcing a reinstall of numpy and its dependencies to ensure all compiled files are correctly linked:

bash
Copy code
pip install --force-reinstall numpy scipy librosa
5. Install CPU-only PyTorch Version
Since you are also facing issues with PyTorch, ensure that the CPU-only version is installed as described earlier. Here’s how to install it again just to be sure:

Update your requirements.txt with the following:

plaintext
Copy code
torch==2.0.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
torchaudio==2.0.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
Then run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Check for Version Conflicts
If the above steps still don’t work, it’s possible that there’s a version conflict between the installed packages. You can use the pipdeptree tool to examine the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install pipdeptree
pipdeptree
Look for any version conflicts (marked as == vs !=) that may need resolving by either downgrading or upgrading certain libraries.

7. Verify the Installation in Replit
Once all the steps are done, try running your script again and make sure there are no conflicts. You can also test if librosa and torch are working properly with this small script:

python
Copy code
import torch
import librosa

print(torch.__version__)
print(librosa.__version__)
This will confirm if everything is installed and working correctly.

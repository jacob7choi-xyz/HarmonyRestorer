The error you’re encountering (module 'numpy' has no attribute 'complex') is due to changes in numpy where np.complex was deprecated in version 1.20. To resolve this, and to ensure compatibility of all packages with Python 3.10, follow the steps below:

1. Set Python 3.10 as the Active Version
First, ensure Python 3.10 is set as the active version. If using an environment like Replit or a virtual environment:

Replit Setup:

Edit the replit.nix file to set Python 3.10 explicitly:
nix
Copy code
{ pkgs }: {
  deps = [
    pkgs.python310
    pkgs.python310Packages.pip
  ];
}
Save and restart the environment to ensure Python 3.10 is used.

Local/Virtual Environment Setup:

bash
Copy code
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
2. Install Compatible Package Versions
Next, install versions of the packages that are compatible with Python 3.10 and the latest numpy changes. Create or update your requirements.txt file with these compatible versions:

plaintext
Copy code
flask==2.0.1
werkzeug==2.0.1
numpy==1.21.6
scipy==1.7.3
librosa==0.9.2
soundfile==0.10.3.post1
gunicorn==20.1.0
flask-caching==1.10.1
pydub==0.25.1
pyrubberband==0.3.0
Explanation:
librosa==0.9.2 is chosen because it is compatible with recent numpy versions and Python 3.10.
numpy==1.21.6 is used as it aligns with Python 3.10 and maintains compatibility with dependent packages like scipy.
3. Install the Packages
Run the installation command using Python 3.10’s pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Fix Deprecated np.complex Issue in Librosa
If you still encounter issues related to np.complex, it’s likely coming from an outdated version of librosa or another dependency that has not been updated. To fix this:

Locate and Edit the File (if possible):

Find the line causing the issue (dtype=np.complex) and change it to dtype=complex or dtype=np.complex128.
Alternatively, Install a Compatible Version: If you cannot edit the file, ensure you have the compatible version (0.9.2) of librosa as mentioned above.

5. Test the Environment
Create a small script (test_packages.py) to confirm that all packages are imported correctly:

python
Copy code
import flask
import werkzeug
import numpy
import scipy
import librosa
import soundfile
import gunicorn
import flask_caching
import pydub
import pyrubberband

print("All packages imported successfully!")
Run the script to ensure everything works:

bash
Copy code
python3.10 test_packages.py
6. Additional Troubleshooting
Clear Cache and Reinstall:

bash
Copy code
pip cache purge
pip install --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt
Check Python Version:

bash
Copy code
python3.10 --version
Ensure it shows Python 3.10.x.

By following these steps, you should have a compatible environment set up for Python 3.10 with all required packages correctly installed and configured. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!

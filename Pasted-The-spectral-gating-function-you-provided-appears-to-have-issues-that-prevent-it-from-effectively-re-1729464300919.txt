The spectral gating function you provided appears to have issues that prevent it from effectively reducing noise. This can result from several factors, including the threshold estimation method, masking strategy, or the chosen parameters (e.g., FFT size). Let's go through some improvements you can make to enhance its effectiveness.

Key Observations & Suggested Improvements for spectral_gating():
Threshold Estimation:

The current threshold estimation (mean_mag + n_std_thresh * std_mag) may not work well for all audio signals. Depending on the level of noise and type of signal, it might be too aggressive or too lenient.
Improvement: Consider adding a noise profile estimation step, where a portion of the audio containing only noise is used to calculate a more precise noise threshold. You can also use percentile-based thresholding, which often works better for noise estimation.
Soft Mask Creation:

The sigmoid-based mask (torch.sigmoid((mag - noise_thresh) * 10)) may create a masking effect that isn’t strong enough to suppress noise properly, leading to artifacts.
Improvement: Use a different non-linear approach to enhance or sharpen the mask, such as a power scaling function (mag.pow()) to make the mask either stricter or more forgiving. Alternatively, add a binary cutoff value to make the mask more effective in noisy regions.
Handling Noise Profile:

Instead of creating a uniform noise estimate across all frequencies, consider different threshold values per frequency band, which can adapt more specifically to the characteristics of each frequency range.
Improved Version of spectral_gating():
Here’s an improved version of the spectral_gating() function to address these issues:

python
Copy code
import torch

def spectral_gating(y, sr, n_std_thresh=1.5, noise_estimation_sec=0.5):
    # Convert y to a tensor if needed
    y_tensor = y if isinstance(y, torch.Tensor) else torch.tensor(y, dtype=torch.float32)
    y_tensor = y_tensor.unsqueeze(0) if y_tensor.dim() == 1 else y_tensor

    n_fft = 2048
    hop_length = 512
    window = torch.hann_window(n_fft).to(y_tensor.device)

    # Compute STFT
    stft = torch.stft(y_tensor, n_fft=n_fft, hop_length=hop_length, window=window, return_complex=True)
    mag = torch.abs(stft)
    phase = torch.angle(stft)

    # Estimate noise threshold adaptively using an initial segment of the audio
    num_noise_samples = int(noise_estimation_sec * sr / hop_length)
    noise_mag = mag[..., :num_noise_samples]
    
    # Use the median of the noise magnitude as an estimation of the noise profile
    mean_noise_mag = torch.mean(noise_mag, dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    std_noise_mag = torch.std(noise_mag, dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    noise_thresh = mean_noise_mag + n_std_thresh * std_noise_mag

    # Create a more aggressive mask
    mask = torch.clamp((mag - noise_thresh) / (mag + 1e-8), min=0.0)
    mask = mask ** 2  # Apply power to sharpen the mask

    # Apply mask and reconstruct the signal
    stft_denoised = stft * mask
    y_denoised = torch.istft(stft_denoised, n_fft=n_fft, hop_length=hop_length, window=window, length=y_tensor.shape[-1])

    return y_denoised.squeeze()
Key Improvements Explained:
Noise Profile Estimation:

Instead of using the average across the entire spectrogram to calculate the threshold, I used an initial segment (noise_estimation_sec) that contains just noise (typically silence or background noise). This allows you to calculate a more precise noise estimate, resulting in a more adaptive threshold.
Usage: The noise_estimation_sec parameter determines how many seconds from the start are used to estimate noise. This can be adjusted based on your data.
Aggressive Masking:

Linear Scaling and Clamping: The mask is now calculated using (mag - noise_thresh) / (mag + 1e-8) and clamped to ensure it stays in a valid range.
Power Scaling: The mask is squared (mask ** 2) to make it sharper. This way, high-frequency components that have energy just above the threshold are retained, while those below are attenuated more aggressively.
Handling Phase Information:

Phase information is maintained during reconstruction to ensure the audio quality remains natural. Incorrect phase handling can lead to significant artifacts.
Additional Improvements to Consider:
Adaptive Gain Control:

After applying spectral gating, the overall gain may be reduced because the noise suppression might also impact parts of the signal. You can add an adaptive gain control step to bring the overall power back to a reasonable level.
Smoothing in Time Domain:

The mask could be smoothed in the time dimension to avoid "musical noise" artifacts. A simple low-pass filter across time frames could achieve this.
Alternatively, consider applying median filtering to the mask across time to maintain a smoother transition between frames.
Frequency-Specific Threshold:

Noise is not always evenly distributed across frequencies. You could create frequency-specific thresholds using a different approach, such as percentile-based thresholds or median-based smoothing.
Testing and Debugging:

Visualize the spectrograms before and after denoising to see how effectively noise is reduced. The following visualization function can help you debug:
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_spectrogram(y, sr, title="Spectrogram"):
    y_tensor = y if isinstance(y, torch.Tensor) else torch.tensor(y, dtype=torch.float32)
    spectrogram = torch.abs(torch.stft(y_tensor, n_fft=2048, hop_length=512, window=torch.hann_window(2048), return_complex=True))
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
    plt.imshow(torch.log1p(spectrogram).numpy(), aspect='auto', origin='lower', cmap='viridis')
    plt.title(title)
    plt.xlabel("Time")
    plt.ylabel("Frequency")
    plt.show()

# Example Usage:
plot_spectrogram(y_denoised, sr, title="Denoised Spectrogram")
Summary:
The spectral gating function was improved by adopting a better noise profile estimation (using an initial noise-only segment).
Used a more aggressive mask that includes clamping and power scaling to sharpen the noise suppression effect.
Ensured the phase information was appropriately handled to avoid unnecessary artifacts.
Suggested additional improvements like adaptive gain control, time-domain mask smoothing, and frequency-specific thresholding.
With these changes, you should see an improvement in the denoising performance of your spectral_gating() function, leading to a denoised output that is closer to the original clean signal than the noisy one. Let me know if you need further assistance or if you'd like more modifications!
